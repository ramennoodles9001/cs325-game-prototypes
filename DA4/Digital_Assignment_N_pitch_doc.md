Input is mouse and keyboard, Randomness is mostly deterministic, playstyle is explorer and achiever. Genre is adventure platofrmer and rpg. 
* **Prototype Goal:** What game mechanic is this prototype evaluating?
The prototype is evaluating the combat of the game and a simple quest system.
* **Player Experience Goals:** What experience do you want players to have when playing your game?
I want players to be able to have the freedom to do what they want but with obstacles they must overcome.
* **Gameplay:** A paragraph describing the actions the player can perform, the system dynamics, and the core mechanic. Include a concise explanation of the prototypeâ€™s inputs and their expected effects (how to play). You can also describe game play that is not in the prototype. You may include mock-up images for parts of the game not in the prototype.
The game allows for players to attack and move. It features bandits throughout the map that attack when you get close. While there is rolling, shielding, and a stamina system, I did not have enough time to implement these fully so that will be done in 4b. Finally there is a simple kill quest system.

I think hit and run will be the most effective for combat.
* **Story/Setting/Premise:** A paragraph about the world your game is set in and who the characters are. What makes the game world and its occupants unique and interesting? Do the tokens represent something? If the game has a backstory, mention it here. If the game is abstract, then say so. How will the dramatic tension interact with the gameplay tension?
You are a lone knight who is exploring a forgotten world to find the mysteries of the past. The story will be told in quests and lore and such will be slowly discovered through gameplay.
* **Target Audience:** A single sentence that describes the demographic you're trying to reach.
I am reaching for the RPG demographic.

A few minutes for now.
